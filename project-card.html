<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="light-field">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    I keep tabs on my airlines frequent flier miles and credit card reward
    points. Sometimes though, it's difficult to keep track of all of them, or to
    understand what is the optimal usage of points. Is there an opportunity
    there? Perhaps. But for now, I'm using this idea as a sample to test out and
    learn new tools.

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>
    The main goal for this project was to better understand React structure and
    implementation. I've also heard good things about Firebase, and wanted to
    understand that better.
