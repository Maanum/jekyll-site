### Overview

I keep tabs on my airlines frequent flier miles and credit card reward points.
Sometimes though, it's difficult to keep track of all of them, or to
understand what is the optimal usage of points. Is there an opportunity there?
Perhaps. But for now, I'm using this idea as a sample to test out and learn new tools.

### Desired Outcomes

The main **goal** for this project was to better understand React structure and
implementation. I've also heard good things about Firebase, and wanted to
understand that better.

**Objectives** include:

- Identify the optimal credit card that a user should use for a given purchase
- Implement site using React
- Host site on Firebase>
- (optional) Use Firebase functions/database elements as appropriate
